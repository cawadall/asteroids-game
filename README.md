ASTEROIDS GAME
---

The classical asteroids game using Web Technologies where a SpaceShip must navigate through space eliminating the asteroids that it finds in its path.

### Usage

#### Execution:
Just double-clicking the HTML file.

#### Controls:
Use the following keys:
    - w - Go forward
    - a - Turn left
    - d - Turn Right
    - s - Go backwards
    - x - Shoot

**Note**: The inertia of the SpaceShip is controlled by pressing the same key several times. That means that the more certain key is pressed, the more increases the 'velocity' of the associated action. To slow the ship movement just press the key that executes the opposite action (i.e. forward <-> backwards) in the same way.
